# 🏢 Mini HRMS System

## About the System

The **Mini HRMS (Human Resource Management System)** is a web-based admin tool designed to help organizations manage their workforce efficiently. It allows an admin to handle core HR operations in one place — from tracking employee records and monitoring attendance, to computing salaries and generating payroll summaries.

The system is built with simplicity and usability in mind, making it easy for non-technical admin users to navigate and operate day-to-day HR tasks without hassle.
